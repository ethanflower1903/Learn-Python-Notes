# Warm-up / Info
* as a warm up these notes will show info for creating a simple card game ("War")
* the ```project_code``` folder contians the actual project
### How does the card game war work?:
* you start with a 52 card deck
* you shuffle the deck and split it into 2 decks (each player gets half of the deck)
* each player draws a card and lays it on the table
* the player to draw the higher card takes both cards and adds them to thier deck
* if players pull the same card then its considered "war". the players then have to take out an extra set of cards and whoever wins the next round keeps all the extra cards.
* the player who loses is the one who has no more cards left

We need to construct the following for this:
* card class
* deck class
* player class
* game logic
* the game will be played by the PC not by humans
