# Python Setup Notes
***
* Installing Python
* How to run Python code
***
# Installing Python 3 (anaconda version):
* Installing Python using Anaconda installs additional libraries that you may need all within one install package
1. Go to the download website: www.anaconda.com/downloads
2. Download and install the version needed for your system

# Use Jupyter Notebook
1. Open Anaconda Navigator. Anaconda Navigator is like a home for launching enviorments for running Python code.
2. Launch "Jupyter Notebook"
3. Create a temporary folder
4. Create a new notebook
5. You can then run code. For example you can try typing 
```1+1``` and then clicking "run cells"

# More Options for Running Python
* You can use jupyter.org/try to use a cloud hosted jupyter notebook. This is good for testing things out quickly however it doesnt save anything you do permanently. You can save your work locally though.
* colab.research.google.com allows you to run a google version of Jupyter notebooks and allows you to save your work.
* repl.it is a cloud based IDE which you can use to code Python.

# Running Python Code
## Ways to run Python Code
### Text Editors:
* EX: Sublime Text, Atom
### Full IDE's:
* Has additional features designed specifically for the language
* EX: PyCharm, Spyder 
### Notebook Enviorments:
* Good for learning
* You can see the input and the output next to each other
* Supports in-line markdown notes
* Uses a special file extension (not .py - it uses .ipynb)
* EX: Jupyter Notebook

#### Running a Python Script (CMD):
```
python first-python-script.py
```
#### Using the Python Console (CMD):
```
python
```
* to exit:
```
quit()
```
#### Running a Jupyter Notebook:
* Launch Jupyter notebook from Anaconda
* (you can use Jupyter for text editing if desired) 
* Create a new python notebook
* You can then run code. For example you can try typing 
```1+1``` and then clicking "run cells" which will show you the output
* You can then save the code as well which saves the document as .ipynb (you can only open the files through Jupyter Notebook)
